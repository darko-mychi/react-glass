# Store

This store directory is based on the VueX store and is powered by the warp utility in `utils/Warp.js`. Warp allows you to break up your store into modules which allows you to have states defined in a more readable and friendly manner.

Warp is still incomplete, and will contain more methods and bug fixes in later versions.
